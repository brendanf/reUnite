# reUnite v0.2

* Change project name to the more descriptive "reUnite"
* Add Silva LSU data sets (Parc, Ref, and Ref NR99)
* Include version of Unite with only RefS singletons ("`nosingle`"), as well as
  with all singletons ("`single`").
* Update to Unite 8.2.
* Add changes2 files, which document intermediate changes to taxonomy.
* Correct Attine ant cultivars which are incorrectly annotated with the genus of
  the ant rather than the fungus.
* Correct some errors with names which match in multiple kingdoms.
* Trunctate taxonomy annotation when all the lower taxa are _incertae sedis_ or
  unknown.
* Remove sequences which have absolutely no usable taxonomy (e.g., sequences
  whose only annotation is "Protista").
* Make some additions to the taxonomy of Tedersoo 2017, in cases where a new
  genus shares a name with a taxon in another kingdom.
